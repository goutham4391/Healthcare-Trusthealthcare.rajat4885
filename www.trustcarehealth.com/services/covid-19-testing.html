Tests are sent to a local lab and results are next day (via the COVID-19 Testing Clinics) but results times at our urgent care clinics vary based on lab volume.\n\nRapid Antibody Blood Test at our Urgent Care Clinics and COVID-19 Testing Clinics: The Healgen COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test is a point-of-care test approved by U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that qualitatively detects and differentiates IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood.

Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.\n\nTake care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.\n\nStay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.\n\nAvoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.\n\nAs much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask.\n\nMonitor your symptoms. Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.\n\nIf you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19."

However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.\n\nHaving antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.\n\nYou should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again."

These persons should follow the guidance below for “I was severely ill with COVID-19 or have a severely weakened immune system (immunocompromised) due to a health condition or medication. When can I be around others?”\n\nI tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms.\n\nIf you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you had a positive viral test for COVID-19. Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.\n\nIf you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for “I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms.”"

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>If you test positive for COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community:</p>
<p><strong>Stay home.</strong> Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
</p>
<p><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong> Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
</p>
<p><strong>Stay in touch with your doctor.</strong> Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
</p>
<p><strong>Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home.</strong> If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask.
</p>
<p><strong>Monitor your symptoms. </strong>Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information. </p>
<p>If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

                    What do my antibody results mean for me?
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.</p>
<p> Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.</p>
<p>You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again.

                    If I already tested positive, how soon can I be tested again?

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>These are the recommendations of the CDC:</p>
<p><em><strong>I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms.</strong></em></p>
<p>You can be around others after:
</p>
<ul><li>10 days since symptoms first appeared<strong> and</strong>
</li><li>24 hours with no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications <strong>and</strong>
</li><li>Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving*
</li></ul>
<p><em>*Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation</em>
</p>
<p>Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.
</p>
<p>Note that these recommendations <strong>do not</strong> apply to persons with severe COVID-19 or with severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised). These persons should follow the guidance below for “I was severely ill with COVID-19 or have a severely weakened immune system (immunocompromised) due to a health condition or medication. When can I be around others?”
</p>
<p><em><strong>I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you had a positive viral test for COVID-19. Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.
</p>
<p>If you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for “I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms.”
